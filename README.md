# ECS160-Final

In `doc`, it will contain the 3 main document we have, which is Design Manual, Project Report, User Manual.
It will also contain the git_log (conversation) we have with chatGPT. Don't have a standard on naming it for now

In `src` will contain all of our `.java` files

**Note**: directories may change in the future implementation
